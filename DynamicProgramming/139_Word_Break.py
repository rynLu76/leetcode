'''
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false

    def wordBreak(self, s, wordDict):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type wordDict: List[str]
        :rtype: bool

        The idea is the following:

        d is an array that contains booleans

        d[i] is True if there is a word in the dictionary that ends at ith index of s AND d is also True at the beginning of the word
        '''
        d = [False] * len(s)    
        for i in range(len(s)):
            for w in wordDict:
                if w == s[i-len(w)+1:i+1] and (d[i-len(w)] or i-len(w) == -1):
                    d[i] = True
        return d[-1]
