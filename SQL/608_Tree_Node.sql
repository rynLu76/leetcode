Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

"Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
"Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
"Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree.



Table: Tree

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| p_id        | int  |
+-------------+------+



----------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT
    id AS `Id`,
    CASE
        WHEN tree.id = (SELECT atree.id FROM tree atree WHERE atree.p_id IS NULL)
          THEN 'Root'
        WHEN tree.id IN (SELECT atree.p_id FROM tree atree)
          THEN 'Inner'
        ELSE 'Leaf'
    END AS Type
FROM
    tree
ORDER BY `Id`
;

Input: 
Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
Output: 
+----+-------+
| id | type  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Root  |
| 2  | Inner |
| 3  | Leaf  |
| 4  | Leaf  |
| 5  | Leaf  |
+----+-------+
